Note that there are several rows with missing values in the price column, which are dealt with during Data Preprocessing. Other features include the name of the host, neighbourhood group, neighbourhood, latitude, longitude, minimum nights to stay, number of reviews about the establishment, the date of the last review, and reviews per month. These features can be used to estimate what an accurate valuation of the Airbnb might be.\n",

Tribeca is the most expensive location in Manhattan based on the data provided/present for entire home/apts, with an average price of approximately $595. These findings allude to the fact that New York's neighbourhood groups have a varying price range of entire home/apt units throught their neighbourhoods."

This could help hosts optimize their pricing strategy and maximize their revenue.\n",
