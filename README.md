## Project Description
This project serves as a case study of the whole data science pipeline from acquiring and curating data, parsing the data into a queryable format, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing and machine learning, and explaining the results with words and visualizations.

## Dataset
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjitbaishya001/airbnb-new-york-jan-2024?select=detailed_reviews.csv, sourced from Airbnb
Description: Airbnb data from New York focussing on listings, locations, and user reviews of locations

## Reason for choosing dataset
This dataset was chosen to establish answers for several common perceptions about Airbnb listings and whether conclusions are justified. These include questions like:

- Location Preferences: By analyzing review sentiments and ratings across different neighborhoods in New York City, you can identify which areas are most preferred by guests. This information can be valuable for both hosts and guests in making decisions about where to stay or list their properties.

- Property Features and Amenities: Understanding which amenities and features receive the highest praise in reviews can inform hosts about what guests value the most. For example, if reviews consistently highlight the importance of a well-equipped kitchen or a comfortable bed, hosts can prioritize these aspects to attract more guests.

- Price Sensitivity: Analyzing the relationship between listing prices and review scores can reveal whether guests perceive higher-priced listings as offering better value or if they are more critical of expensive properties. This information can help hosts optimize their pricing strategies.

- Impact of Superhosts: Analyzing the difference in review scores between Superhost properties and regular listings can shed light on the importance of this designation in guests' decision-making process. It can also provide insights into the specific aspects that contribute to Superhosts' higher ratings, such as responsiveness and overall hospitality.

- Competitive Analysis: Comparing review data across different Airbnb listings can help hosts benchmark their performance against competitors and identify areas for improvement. This can include aspects such as pricing, amenities, and overall guest experience.
